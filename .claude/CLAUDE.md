npm run type-check                                         # TypeScript compilation validation
```

### 🚨 **CRITICAL TESTING REQUIREMENT - UPDATED**

**MANDATORY**: After making ANY changes to components, pages, or business logic, you MUST run ALL these tests before marking a task complete:

```bash
# REQUIRED TESTS - ALL TASKS MUST PASS THESE:
npm run type-check                           # TypeScript compilation & JSX syntax
npm run test:e2e tests/core/                 # Core functionality & infinite loop detection  
npm run test:e2e tests/workflows/            # Workflow-specific tests
npm run dev                                  # Verify server starts without errors
curl http://localhost:3002/workflow-editor  # Test page loads (should return 200)
```

**🔥 ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: 
- **NO task is complete** until ALL tests pass
- **NO infinite loops or performance regressions** are acceptable
- **ALL pages must load within 8 seconds** or less
- **Console errors** related to React, rendering, or JavaScript are blocking issues

**Comprehensive Testing Coverage**:

## 🎯 **COMPREHENSIVE FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - DECEMBER 2025**

### **CRITICAL PROJECT UPDATE**: Complete Appointment & Workflow System Implementation

**Status**: 🚧 **NOW IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**

This section documents the complete conversation and planning session for implementing the full business automation system. All details and decisions from the comprehensive planning discussion are preserved here for future reference.

---

## **Business Requirements Summary**

### **Core Business Flow**
1. **Import clients** from Aesthetic Record (CSV format, duplicate prevention by email/phone)
2. **Google Calendar sync** - Real-time bi-directional sync with multiple staff calendars  
3. **Smart client matching** - Match calendar appointments to client database using fuzzy matching
4. **Appointment check-in system** - Mark clients as shown/no-show/late/rescheduled
5. **Workflow automation** - Trigger automated messaging workflows based on appointment status
6. **Multi-channel messaging** - AWS SNS/SES (primary) + MailChimp (backup) for emails/SMS
7. **Template system** - Customizable message templates with variables
8. **Opt-out compliance** - Full HIPAA and CAN-SPAM compliance with granular opt-outs

### **Key Business Rules**
- **Workflow Triggers**: Cancel existing workflow and restart fresh when new trigger fires
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Email is primary unique identifier, with phone number and name similarity checks  
- **Calendar Integration**: Real-time sync requirement - calendar changes must appear instantly
- **Message Volume**: 1000-2000 messages/month currently, planning for up to 5000
- **Geographic Scope**: Currently Utah (Mountain Time), expanding to multiple locations
- **User Scale**: 1-20 users per organization maximum

---

## **Technical Architecture Decisions**

### **Database Schema Additions** (New Tables Required)
```sql
-- Calendar Integration
calendar_connections (id, orgId, calendarId, calendarName, ownerEmail, accessToken, refreshToken, isActive)
calendar_sync_log (id, orgId, calendarId, syncedAt, eventsProcessed, errors)

-- Enhanced Appointments
appointment_checkins (id, appointmentId, status[scheduled/shown/no_show/late/rescheduled], checkedInBy, checkedInAt, notes)
appointment_sync_status (id, appointmentId, calendarEventId, lastSyncedAt, syncStatus)

-- Smart Duplicate Detection  
potential_duplicates (id, clientId, suspectedDuplicateId, matchType[email/phone/name], confidence, resolvedAt, resolvedBy)

-- Communication Preferences & Opt-outs
client_communication_preferences (id, clientId, smsOptOut, emailOptOut, marketingOptOut, optOutDate, optOutReason)

-- Message Templates & Variables
template_variables (id, orgId, name, description, variableKey, isCustom, createdBy)
message_templates (id, orgId, name, type[sms/email], subject, content, variables[], imageUrl, isActive)
message_campaigns (id, orgId, templateId, recipientCount, sentAt, deliveryStatus)

-- Message Delivery Tracking
message_deliveries (id, clientId, campaignId, templateId, channel[sms/email], status[queued/sent/delivered/failed/bounced], provider[aws/mailchimp], externalId, sentAt, deliveredAt, errorMessage)

-- Enhanced Workflow System
workflow_triggers (id, workflowId, triggerType, conditions, isActive)
workflow_enrollments_history (id, enrollmentId, action[enrolled/cancelled/completed], reason, timestamp)
```

### **Smart Name Matching Algorithm**
```typescript
// Multi-factor confidence scoring:
1. Exact email match → 100% confidence (auto-match)
2. Phone number match → 95% confidence (auto-match)  
3. Fuzzy name matching (Levenshtein distance) → 60-90% confidence
4. Combined name + partial phone → 70-85% confidence

// Decision thresholds:
- >90%: Auto-match
- 60-90%: Manual review queue
- <60%: Create new client with duplicate warning
```

### **Real-Time Calendar Integration**
- **Google Calendar webhooks** for instant event notifications
- **Polling fallback** every 5 minutes for reliability  
- **Bi-directional sync** (calendar ↔ database)
- **Multiple calendar support** per organization
- **OAuth2 per staff member** with organization-wide visibility

### **Message Template Variables System**
```typescript
// Default system variables:
{firstName}, {lastName}, {fullName}, {email}, {phone}
{appointmentType}, {appointmentDate}, {appointmentTime}
{nextAppointmentDate}, {staffName}, {businessName}
{reviewLink}, {unsubscribeLink}, {orgName}, {orgPhone}

// Custom variable management:
- Organization-specific custom variables
- Variable creation interface for staff
- Template preview with sample data
- Variable validation and testing
```

### **Enhanced Workflow Trigger System**
```typescript
// New trigger types:
- appointment_completed (fires when marked "shown")
- appointment_no_show (fires when marked "no show")
- appointment_late (fires when marked "late")
- appointment_rescheduled (fires when rescheduled)
- client_created (fires for new client)
- tag_added/removed (fires on client tag changes)

// Workflow behavior:
- Cancel existing active workflows when new trigger fires
- Support one-time vs recurring workflows
- Complex conditional logic (appointment type, tags, visit history)
- Workflow must be "active" to trigger
```

## 🚨 **Critical Development Notes**

### Current Issues & Workarounds
1. **npm signature verification error**: Use `NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/npm-cache npm install` or install with `--no-audit --no-fund`
2. **Drizzle users2 error**: Cosmetic issue during test data generation, doesn't affect functionality
3. **Convex references**: Some components still reference old Convex queries, need updating to Drizzle

### Authentication System Testing
```bash
# Test core authentication functions
npx tsx -e "
const { hashPassword, verifyPassword, generateToken } = require('./src/lib/auth-utils');
// Test functions directly
"

# Test database connectivity
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u honeyrae -phoneyrae honey_rae

# Test Next.js startup
npm run dev # Should start on localhost:3000
```

### Security Requirements
- Never commit DATABASE_URL or other secrets
- All passwords must pass strength validation
- 2FA required for admin accounts in production
- Regular security audits required
- HIPAA compliance for client data

---

## 📚 **Code Standards & Guidelines**

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`AuthForm`, `PermissionManager`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for pages, PascalCase for components
- **Database Tables**: snake_case (`user_sessions`, `org_permissions`)
- **Permissions**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`USERS_VIEW`, `MASTER_ADMIN`)

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict mode (enabled)
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use Drizzle schema types: `InferSelectModel<typeof users>`
- Avoid `any` - use proper types from schema

### Authentication Patterns
```typescript
// Use NextAuth session
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react';
const { data: session } = useSession();

// Check permissions
import { hasPermission, PERMISSIONS } from '@/lib/permissions';
const canManageUsers = await hasPermission(userId, PERMISSIONS.USERS_MANAGE);

// Database queries with org isolation
const clients = await db.select().from(clientsTable).where(eq(clientsTable.orgId, session.user.orgId));
```

### Testing Patterns
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Use real database for integration tests
- Test authentication flows end-to-end
- Verify data isolation between organizations

---

## 🔍 **Debugging & Development Tools**

### Available Debug Pages
- `/api/auth/providers` - Test NextAuth providers
- `/api/auth/session` - View current session data
- Direct database queries with MySQL CLI

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check authentication system health
npm run test:auth-validate

# View database tables
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u honeyrae -phoneyrae -e "SHOW TABLES;" honey_rae

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test Next.js compilation
npm run build
```
