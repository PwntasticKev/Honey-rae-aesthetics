Honey Rae Automation Platform – Full Conversational Context Recap (Transcript Style)

---

Kevin: I’m thinking React, TypeScript, TanStack Query, Convex – basically the modern T3 stack approach. I want everything clean, performant, and scalable with full org/user/client structure.

We aligned that Convex is our backend/state layer, and AWS S3 will be used for media storage — especially since each client could have 50+ images. Storing in Convex is ~10x more expensive than S3 for this scale (5000 clients × 50 images = 250,000 images). S3 will use folders like: `org-id/client-id/image.jpg`.

Entities:

- Org: the signed-up business
- User: belongs to org, can be admin, manager, staff
- Client: the actual end-customer, gets media, notes, appointments
- Appointments: tied to Google Calendar
- Workflows: conditional automation logic for actions (text, email, tag)
- MessageTemplate: reusable SMS/email templates with merge tags
- Files: photos tagged (before, after, inspiration), cropped, previewed, stored in S3

Core features include:

1. **Photo Gallery** – Drag/drop upload, cropping, tag support, S3-hosted.
2. **Workflows** – Triggers (appointment complete, new client), delays, conditions, actions (text/email).
3. **Text/Email Engine** – Tag support (`{{first_name}}`, etc.), AWS SNS/SES backed, schedule or trigger-based.
4. **Client Timeline** – Horizontal UI timeline with events: appointments, photos, notes, messages, custom events.
5. **Social Scheduler** – Create/publish to Instagram, Google Business, TikTok. Cropping per-platform, multi-preview.
6. **Team Management** – Invite users, assign roles, audit logging.
7. **Billing** – Stripe integration. Usage tracking per org: SMS, storage, workflows triggered. Pricing tiers with dynamic upgrades.
8. **Analytics Dashboard** – Clients added, messages sent, workflows triggered, platform performance, best-performing templates.
9. **Patient Journey** – Track treatment stages per client, show photo progress, alert for check-ins.
10. **Onboarding Import** – Full CSV import of fields: name, email, gender, phones, dob, address, referral source, etc.
11. **QR/Subdomain White Labeling** – Clinics can customize login via subdomain or QR, unique branding, logo, templates.
12. **Google Calendar Sync** – Auto-import events by provider, link to clients by email/name, use as workflow triggers.
13. **File Tagging & Cropping** – Store crop coordinates, tags, and thumbnail. Group by tag/date in UI.
14. **AI Future Roadmap** – Automatic workflow generation, post captions, image analysis, journey milestone predictions.

We walked through cost comparisons:

- Convex is great for state/workflows/data, but not for heavy file storage
- AWS S3: $1.61/month for 70 GB (vs. Convex $14 for same)
- SNS (SMS): ~$20–40/month for 20k messages
- SES (Email): ~$3/month for 30k emails

We also talked about handling:

- Referral source tracking
- Memberships
- Staff notes per client
- Appointment follow-ups
- Client portal statuses
- Fire/dismissal tracking

Kevin: I want this so detailed I can paste it into Cursor and have AI pick up right where I left off. Everything we build needs to scale, stay flexible for future features (like an AI assistant or HIPAA toggle), and follow strict React/TypeScript best practices — no for loops, everything alphabetized, no `any`.
