# Command Line

- run sudo with everything. ( sudo npm i) for example. but if youre deleting anything other than node_modules or package json. I want to be warned

Assume I always have my server running and I have a terminal open.

try not to start up your own server and just assume mines is running. if its not running, Then you may start it up.
